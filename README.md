🏎️ SpyneAuto – Car Management System
SpyneAuto is a Full-Stack Car Management Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) where users can:

Sign up and log in.
Add, edit, view, and delete cars.
Attach up to 10 images per car.
Search cars using keywords.
Only manage their own cars (authentication and authorization).

📋 Features
User Authentication: Secure JWT-based authentication system with login and registration.
Car Management: Add, update, view, and delete cars.
Image Upload: Upload up to 10 images for each car.
Search Functionality: Search for cars by title, description, or tags (car type, company, dealer).
Responsive Design: The frontend is fully responsive, built with Tailwind CSS.
Protected Routes: Only authenticated users can manage their own cars.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Axios, React Router, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
Image Storage: Cloudinary (or similar cloud-based storage) for handling image uploads
Database: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas)
Deployment: Render (or any cloud platform like Heroku or DigitalOcean)

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from here.
MongoDB: You should have a MongoDB instance running locally or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based solution.
Cloudinary: If you're using Cloudinary for image storage, you'll need an account and API credentials.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spyneauto.git
cd spyneauto
Backend Setup:

Navigate to the server/ directory and install the backend dependencies:

bash

cd server
npm install
Frontend Setup:

Navigate to the client/ directory and install the frontend dependencies:

bash

cd ../client
npm install
Configuration
Backend Configuration:

Create a .env file inside the server/ directory with the following content (replace placeholders with actual values):

env

PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/spyneauto
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
Frontend Configuration:

Create a .env file inside the client/ directory with the following content:

env

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
Running the Application
Start the Backend:

In the server/ directory, run the following command to start the backend server:

bash

npm run dev
Start the Frontend:

In the client/ directory, run the following command to start the frontend React app:

bash

npm start
Access the Application:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access SpyneAuto.

📂 Project Structure
Backend (server/)
The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express, and includes the following structure:

server/
├── config/ # Configuration files (e.g., cloudinary config)
├── controllers/ # API controllers (auth, car management)
├── middleware/ # Custom middleware (e.g., auth middleware)
├── models/ # Mongoose models (User, Car)
├── routes/ # API routes (auth, cars)
├── swagger/ # Swagger API documentation setup
├── .env # Environment variables (not committed)
├── server.js # Entry point for the backend server
Frontend (client/)
The frontend is built with React and includes the following structure:

client/
├── src/
│ ├── components/ # Reusable components (Navbar, PrivateRoute, etc.)
│ ├── pages/ # Pages (Login, Register, CarsList, CarForm, CarDetails)
│ ├── context/ # AuthContext for managing authentication state
│ ├── services/ # API services (auth, cars)
│ ├── App.js # Main App component with routes setup
│ ├── index.js # Entry point for the frontend
├── .env # Environment variables for React (not committed)

🔐 Authentication
JWT Authentication: The app uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication. The token is stored in localStorage and used for authorizing requests to protected routes.
Private Routes: The app's routes for managing cars are protected using PrivateRoute, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.
📸 Image Upload
Image Upload: Users can upload up to 10 images per car using the frontend form.
Cloudinary Integration: The images are uploaded to Cloudinary, and the image URLs are saved in the MongoDB database.

🧪 Testing
Manual Testing
Postman or cURL can be used for manual API testing.
Ensure that you have valid JWT tokens for protected routes.
Automated Testing
Jest and React Testing Library can be set up for unit and integration tests (not included in the current version).
📦 Deployment
Backend Deployment:
Push the backend code to a GitHub repository.
Use Render or Heroku to deploy the backend.
Make sure to set the environment variables (e.g., MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY) in the deployment platform.
Frontend Deployment:
Build the frontend React app:

bash

cd client
npm run build
Deploy the build folder to Netlify, Vercel, or any other static hosting platform.

Ensure the REACT_APP_API_URL points to the deployed backend.
